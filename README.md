Assignments for Robot SLAM (16-833) @CMU 

If you are currently taking the 16-833 course, I encourage you to try the assignments on your own and preferably not use the code snippets here - since this is a violation of the academic integrity policy of the institute.

If you are here for learning different concepts, please go ahead and refer any snippets.

### Assignment 1 - Particle Filters (Practicum)
### Assignment 2 - Extended Kalman Filter (Practicum)
### Assignment 3 - Linear and Nonlinear SLAM Solvers (Practicum)
